# SeekHue

SeekHue takes an image file, creates a three-tuple of the image pixel color values, and sorts them by their hue, lightness, and saturation--creating a visual representation of color distribution. Visit the proposal [here](/seek_hue.md).

# Setup

There should be no additional set up after cloning this repository. The included media file links to my test images in my database and there is no user functionality to worry about.

# Usage

From the index page you can view previously completed transformations by scrolling your cursor over an original painting, or you can upload your own painting through the submit button.

There is also a search bar that accepts basic search terms, such as a particular artist, country, or art movement.
