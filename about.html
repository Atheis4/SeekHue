            <h2>The Tyranny of Color</h2>
            <p>Color is the most ubiquitous as well as least understood visual phenomenon in nature.</p>
            <p>Color is absolutely relative--what color you perceive depends on specific light conditions as well surrounding colors and the perceptual capablities of the viewer.</p>
            <p>Color can envoke royalty and social status, pride in one's country, the devine, or contamination and disease.</p>

            <h2>Color and Art</h2>
            <p>As technology advanced, new pigments became available for the artist. The greatest advancement in art history is arguably the creation of oil paint.</p>
            <p>Any student of art or art enthusiast recognizes the uniqueness of oil paint: its luminosity, its vibrance, and its staying power.</p>

            <h2>My Relationship to Color</h2>
            <p>As an art student, I was terrified of color.</p>
            <p>Its extreme relativity has, since my first forays into acrylic and oil painting, challenged me and left me unhappy with almost every artistic color choice I have made.</p>
            <p>I designed this project to try and lift the viel and gain a new perspective on the palette's of the great wealth of paintings in art history.</p>

            <h2>Why Paintings?</h2>
            <p>Paintings offer a strict environment in which no coordinate is extraneous--artists have full control over the two dimensional surface and each and every mark that appears there.</p>
            <p>Paintings also offer a huge pre-existing database of images and palettes for my algorithm to explore and analyze.</p>
